# Welcome to Fit Finder

This app is being designed to utilize the iPhone in your pocket to decide what to wear, so you don't have to! The way it will work is by considering the color, appropriate temperature, clothing type, and formality of the clothing to match tops and bottoms. Every day the app will get the temperature from ClimaCell from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm and pick the either formal or casual clothing that fits for that temperature. It will then match those articles of clothing into up to five outfits based off of simple color matching and color theory.

## This is in a Demoable State but not complete.
### Things to consider while running
- Needs the same amount of tops and bottoms to not crash
- Needs clothing for the exact temperature range picked
- All UI is not finalized
### Things we are working on
- A more robust matching algorithm
- More accurate color picking
- More accurate color categorizing
- Unit tests for edge cases
- Refactoring UI based off these design drawings
